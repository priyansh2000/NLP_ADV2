Age, thou art shamed!\\nRome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods! 160\\nWhen went there by an age, since the great flood,\\nBut it was famed with more than with one man?\\nWhen could they say, till now, that talked of Rome,\\nThat her wide walks encompassed but one man?\\nNow is it Rome indeed, and room enough 165\\nWhen there is in it but one only man.\\nO, you and I have heard our fathers say\\nThere was a Brutus once that would have brooked\\nTh\\u2019 eternal devil to keep his state in Rome\\nAs easily as a king. 170\\nBRUTUS\\nThat you do love me, I am nothing jealous.\\nWhat you would work me to, I have some aim.\\nHow I have thought of this, and of these times,\\nI shall recount hereafter. For this present,\\nI would not, so with love I might entreat you, 175\\nBe any further moved. What you have said\\nI will consider; what you have to say\\nI will with patience hear, and find a time\\nBoth meet to hear and answer such high things.\\nTill then, my noble friend, chew upon this: 180\\nBrutus had rather be a villager\\nThan to repute himself a son of Rome\\nUnder these hard conditions as this time\\nIs like to lay upon us.\\nCASSIUS I am glad that my weak words 185\\nHave struck but thus much show of fire from\\nBrutus.\\nEnter Caesar and his train.\\nBRUTUS\\nThe games are done, and Caesar is returning.\\nCASSIUS\\nAs they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,\\nAnd he will, after his sour fashion, tell you 190\\nWhat hath proceeded worthy note today.\\nBRUTUS\\nI will do so. But look you, Cassius,\\nThe angry spot doth glow on Caesar\\u2019s brow,\\nAnd all the rest look like a chidden train.\\nCalphurnia\\u2019s cheek is pale, and Cicero 195\\nLooks with such ferret and such fiery eyes\\nAs we have seen him in the Capitol,\\nBeing crossed in conference by some senators.\\nCASSIUS\\nCasca will tell us what the matter is.\\nCAESAR Antonius. 200\\nANTONY Caesar.\\nCAESAR\\nLet me have men about me that are fat,\\nSleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights.\\nYond Cassius has a lean and hungry look.\\nHe thinks too much. Such men are dangerous. 205\\nANTONY\\nFear him not, Caesar; he\\u2019s not dangerous.\\nHe is a noble Roman, and well given.\\nCAESAR\\nWould he were fatter! But I fear him not.\\nYet if my name were liable to fear,\\nI do not know the man I should avoid 210\\nSo soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much,\\nHe is a great observer, and he looks\\nQuite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays,\\nAs thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;\\nSeldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort 215\\nAs if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit\\nThat could be moved to smile at anything.\\nSuch men as he be never at heart\\u2019s ease\\nWhiles they behold a greater than themselves,\\nAnd therefore are they very dangerous. 220\\nI rather tell thee what is to be feared\\nThan what I fear; for always I am Caesar.\\nCome on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,\\nAnd tell me truly what thou think\\u2019st of him.\\nSennet. Caesar and his train exit\\nbut Casca remains behind.\\nCASCA You pulled me by the cloak. Would you speak 225\\nwith me?\\nBRUTUS\\nAy, Casca. Tell us what hath chanced today\\nThat Caesar looks so sad.\\nCASCA Why, you were with him, were you not?\\nBRUTUS\\nI should not then ask Casca what had chanced. 230\\nCASCA Why, there was a crown offered him; and, being\\noffered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,\\nthus, and then the people fell a-shouting.\\nBRUTUS What was the second noise for?\\nCASCA Why, for that too. 235\\nCASSIUS\\nThey shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?\\nCASCA Why, for that too.\\nBRUTUS Was the crown offered him thrice?\\nCASCA Ay, marry, was \\u2019t, and he put it by thrice, every\\ntime gentler than other; and at every putting-by, 240\\nmine honest neighbors shouted.\\nCASSIUS Who offered him the crown?\\nCASCA Why, Antony.\\nBRUTUS\\nTell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.\\nCASCA I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it. 245\\nIt was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark\\nAntony offer him a crown (yet \\u2019twas not a crown\\nneither; \\u2019twas one of these coronets), and, as I told\\nyou, he put it by once; but for all that, to my\\nthinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered 250\\nit to him again; then he put it by again; but to my\\nthinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it.\\nAnd then he offered it the third time. He put it the\\nthird time by, and still as he refused it the rabblement\\nhooted and clapped their chopped hands and 255\\nthrew up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a\\ndeal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the\\ncrown that it had almost choked Caesar, for he\\nswooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part,\\nI durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and 260\\nreceiving the bad air.\\nCASSIUS\\nBut soft, I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon?\\nCASCA He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at\\nmouth and was speechless.\\nBRUTUS\\n\\u2019Tis very like; he hath the falling sickness. 265\\nCASSIUS\\nNo, Caesar hath it not; but you and I\\nAnd honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.\\nCASCA I know not what you mean by that, but I am\\nsure Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not\\nclap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and 270\\ndispleased them, as they use to do the players in the\\ntheater, I am no true man.\\nBRUTUS\\nWhat said he when he came unto himself?\\nCASCA Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived\\nthe common herd was glad he refused the crown, 275\\nhe plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his\\nthroat to cut. An I had been a man of any occupation,\\nif I would not have taken him at a word, I\\nwould I might go to hell among the rogues. And so\\nhe fell. When he came to himself again, he said if he 280\\nhad done or said anything amiss, he desired their\\nWorships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four\\nwenches where I stood cried \\u201cAlas, good soul!\\u201d and\\nforgave him with all their hearts. But there\\u2019s no\\nheed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stabbed 285\\ntheir mothers, they would have done no less.\\nBRUTUS\\nAnd, after that, he came thus sad away?\\nCASCA Ay.\\nCASSIUS Did Cicero say anything?\\nCASCA Ay, he spoke Greek. 290\\nCASSIUS To what effect?\\nCASCA Nay, an I tell you that, I\\u2019ll ne\\u2019er look you i\\u2019 th\\u2019\\nface again. But those that understood him smiled at\\none another and shook their heads. But for mine\\nown part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more 295\\nnews too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarves\\noff Caesar\\u2019s images, are put to silence. Fare you\\nwell. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember\\nit.\\nCASSIUS Will you sup with me tonight, Casca? 300\\nCASCA No, I am promised forth.\\nCASSIUS Will you dine with me tomorrow?\\nCASCA Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your\\ndinner worth the eating.\\nCASSIUS Good. I will expect you. 305\\nCASCA Do so. Farewell both. He exits.\\nBRUTUS\\nWhat a blunt fellow is this grown to be!\\nHe was quick mettle when he went to school.\\nCASSIUS\\nSo is he now in execution\\nOf any bold or noble enterprise, 310\\nHowever he puts on this tardy form.\\nThis rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,\\nWhich gives men stomach to digest his words\\nWith better appetite.\\nBRUTUS\\nAnd so it is. For this time I will leave you. 315\\nTomorrow, if you please to speak with me,\\nI will come home to you; or, if you will,\\nCome home to me, and I will wait for you.\\nCASSIUS\\nI will do so. Till then, think of the world.\\nBrutus exits.\\nWell, Brutus, thou art noble. Yet I see 320\\nThy honorable mettle may be wrought\\nFrom that it is disposed. Therefore it is meet\\nThat noble minds keep ever with their likes;\\nFor who so firm that cannot be seduced?\\nCaesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus. 325\\nIf I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius,\\nHe should not humor me. I will this night\\nIn several hands in at his windows throw,\\nAs if they came from several citizens,\\nWritings, all tending to the great opinion 330\\nThat Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely\\nCaesar\\u2019s ambition shall be glanc\\u00e8d at\\nAnd after this, let Caesar seat him sure,\\nFor we will shake him, or worse days endure.\\nHe exits.\"\n",
