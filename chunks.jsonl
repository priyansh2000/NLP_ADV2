Answer me directly.\nCOBBLER A trade, sir, that I hope I may use with a safe\nconscience, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad\nsoles. 15\nFLAVIUS\nWhat trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what\ntrade?\n7\nCOBBLER Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me.\nYet if you be out, sir, I can mend you.\nMARULLUS\nWhat mean\u2019st thou by that? Mend me, thou saucy 20\nfellow?\nCOBBLER Why, sir, cobble you.\nFLAVIUS Thou art a cobbler, art thou?\nCOBBLER Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the\nawl. I meddle with no tradesman\u2019s matters nor 25\nwomen\u2019s matters, but withal I am indeed, sir, a\nsurgeon to old shoes: when they are in great danger,\nI recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon\nneat\u2019s leather have gone upon my handiwork.\nFLAVIUS\nBut wherefore art not in thy shop today? 30\nWhy dost thou lead these men about the streets?\nCOBBLER Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to\nget myself into more work. But indeed, sir, we\nmake holiday to see Caesar and to rejoice in his\ntriumph. 35\nMARULLUS\nWherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?\nWhat tributaries follow him to Rome\nTo grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?\nYou blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless\nthings! 40\nO you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,\nKnew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft\nHave you climbed up to walls and battlements,\nTo towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,\nYour infants in your arms, and there have sat 45\nThe livelong day, with patient expectation,\nTo see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.\nAnd when you saw his chariot but appear,\nHave you not made an universal shout,\nThat Tiber trembled underneath her banks 50\nTo hear the replication of your sounds\nMade in her concave shores?\nAnd do you now put on your best attire?\nAnd do you now cull out a holiday?\nAnd do you now strew flowers in his way 55\nThat comes in triumph over Pompey\u2019s blood?\nBe gone!\nRun to your houses, fall upon your knees,\nPray to the gods to intermit the plague\nThat needs must light on this ingratitude. 60\nFLAVIUS\nGo, go, good countrymen, and for this fault\nAssemble all the poor men of your sort,\nDraw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears\nInto the channel, till the lowest stream\nDo kiss the most exalted shores of all. 65\nAll the Commoners exit.\nSee whe\u2019er their basest mettle be not moved.\nThey vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.\nGo you down that way towards the Capitol.\nThis way will I. Disrobe the images\nIf you do find them decked with ceremonies. 70\nMARULLUS May we do so?\nYou know it is the feast of Lupercal.\nFLAVIUS\nIt is no matter. Let no images\nBe hung with Caesar\u2019s trophies. I\u2019ll about\nAnd drive away the vulgar from the streets; 75\nSo do you too, where you perceive them thick.\nThese growing feathers plucked from Caesar\u2019s wing\nWill make him fly an ordinary pitch,\nWho else would soar above the view of men\nAnd keep us all in servile fearfulness. 80\nThey exit in different directions."}

Speak once again.\nSOOTHSAYER Beware the ides of March.\nCAESAR\nHe is a dreamer. Let us leave him. Pass.\nSennet. All but Brutus and Cassius exit.\nCASSIUS\nWill you go see the order of the course? 30\nBRUTUS Not I.\nCASSIUS I pray you, do.\nBRUTUS\nI am not gamesome. I do lack some part\nOf that quick spirit that is in Antony.\nLet me not hinder, Cassius, your desires. 35\nI\u2019ll leave you.\nCASSIUS\nBrutus, I do observe you now of late.\nI have not from your eyes that gentleness\nAnd show of love as I was wont to have.\nYou bear too stubborn and too strange a hand 40\nOver your friend that loves you.\nBRUTUS Cassius,\nBe not deceived. If I have veiled my look,\nI turn the trouble of my countenance\nMerely upon myself. Vex\u00e8d I am 45\nOf late with passions of some difference,\nConceptions only proper to myself,\nWhich give some soil, perhaps, to my behaviors.\nBut let not therefore my good friends be grieved\n(Among which number, Cassius, be you one) 50\nNor construe any further my neglect\nThan that poor Brutus, with himself at war,\nForgets the shows of love to other men.\nCASSIUS\nThen, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,\nBy means whereof this breast of mine hath buried 55\nThoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.\nTell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?\nBRUTUS\nNo, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself\nBut by reflection, by some other things.\nCASSIUS \u2019Tis just. 60\nAnd it is very much lamented, Brutus,\nThat you have no such mirrors as will turn\nYour hidden worthiness into your eye,\nThat you might see your shadow. I have heard\nWhere many of the best respect in Rome, 65\nExcept immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus\nAnd groaning underneath this age\u2019s yoke,\nHave wished that noble Brutus had his eyes.\nBRUTUS\nInto what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,\nThat you would have me seek into myself 70\nFor that which is not in me?\nCASSIUS\nTherefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear.\nAnd since you know you cannot see yourself\nSo well as by reflection, I, your glass,\nWill modestly discover to yourself 75\nThat of yourself which you yet know not of.\nAnd be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus.\nWere I a common laughter, or did use\nTo stale with ordinary oaths my love\nTo every new protester; if you know 80\nThat I do fawn on men and hug them hard\nAnd after scandal them, or if you know\nThat I profess myself in banqueting\nTo all the rout, then hold me dangerous.\nFlourish and shout.\nBRUTUS\nWhat means this shouting? I do fear the people 85\nChoose Caesar for their king.\nCASSIUS Ay, do you fear it?\nThen must I think you would not have it so.\nBRUTUS\nI would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.\nBut wherefore do you hold me here so long? 90\nWhat is it that you would impart to me?\nIf it be aught toward the general good,\nSet honor in one eye and death i\u2019 th\u2019 other\nAnd I will look on both indifferently;\nFor let the gods so speed me as I love 95\nThe name of honor more than I fear death.\nCASSIUS\nI know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,\nAs well as I do know your outward favor.\nWell, honor is the subject of my story.\nI cannot tell what you and other men 100\nThink of this life; but, for my single self,\nI had as lief not be as live to be\nIn awe of such a thing as I myself.\nI was born free as Caesar; so were you;\nWe both have fed as well, and we can both 105\nEndure the winter\u2019s cold as well as he.\nFor once, upon a raw and gusty day,\nThe troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,\nCaesar said to me \u201cDar\u2019st thou, Cassius, now\nLeap in with me into this angry flood 110\nAnd swim to yonder point?\u201d Upon the word,\nAccoutered as I was, I plung\u00e8d in\nAnd bade him follow; so indeed he did.\nThe torrent roared, and we did buffet it\nWith lusty sinews, throwing it aside 115\nAnd stemming it with hearts of controversy.\nBut ere we could arrive the point proposed,\nCaesar cried \u201cHelp me, Cassius, or I sink!\u201d\nI, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,\nDid from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder 120\nThe old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber\nDid I the tired Caesar. And this man\nIs now become a god, and Cassius is\nA wretched creature and must bend his body\nIf Caesar carelessly but nod on him. 125\nHe had a fever when he was in Spain,\nAnd when the fit was on him, I did mark\nHow he did shake. \u2019Tis true, this god did shake.\nHis coward lips did from their color fly,\nAnd that same eye whose bend doth awe the world 130\nDid lose his luster. I did hear him groan.\nAy, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans\nMark him and write his speeches in their books,\n\u201cAlas,\u201d it cried \u201cGive me some drink, Titinius\u201d\nAs a sick girl. You gods, it doth amaze me 135\nA man of such a feeble temper should\nSo get the start of the majestic world\nAnd bear the palm alone.\nShout. Flourish.\nBRUTUS Another general shout!\nI do believe that these applauses are 140\nFor some new honors that are heaped on Caesar.\nCASSIUS\nWhy, man, he doth bestride the narrow world\nLike a Colossus, and we petty men\nWalk under his huge legs and peep about\nTo find ourselves dishonorable graves. 145\nMen at some time are masters of their fates.\nThe fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,\nBut in ourselves, that we are underlings.\n\u201cBrutus\u201d and \u201cCaesar\u201d\u2014what should be in that\n\u201cCaesar\u201d? 150\nWhy should that name be sounded more than\nyours?\nWrite them together, yours is as fair a name;\nSound them, it doth become the mouth as well;\nWeigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with \u2019em, 155\n\u201cBrutus\u201d will start a spirit as soon as \u201cCaesar.\u201d\nNow, in the names of all the gods at once,\nUpon what meat doth this our Caesar feed\nThat he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!\nRome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods! 160\nWhen went there by an age, since the great flood,\nBut it was famed with more than with one man?\nWhen could they say, till now, that talked of Rome,\nThat her wide walks encompassed but one man?\nNow is it Rome indeed, and room enough 165\nWhen there is in it but one only man.\nO, you and I have heard our fathers say\nThere was a Brutus once that would have brooked\nTh\u2019 eternal devil to keep his state in Rome\nAs easily as a king. 170\nBRUTUS\nThat you do love me, I am nothing jealous.\nWhat you would work me to, I have some aim.\nHow I have thought of this, and of these times,\nI shall recount hereafter. For this present,\nI would not, so with love I might entreat you, 175\nBe any further moved. What you have said\nI will consider; what you have to say\nI will with patience hear, and find a time\nBoth meet to hear and answer such high things.\nTill then, my noble friend, chew upon this: 180\nBrutus had rather be a villager\nThan to repute himself a son of Rome\nUnder these hard conditions as this time\nIs like to lay upon us.\nCASSIUS I am glad that my weak words 185\nHave struck but thus much show of fire from\nBrutus.\nEnter Caesar and his train.\nBRUTUS\nThe games are done, and Caesar is returning.\nCASSIUS\nAs they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,\nAnd he will, after his sour fashion, tell you 190\nWhat hath proceeded worthy note today.\nBRUTUS\nI will do so. But look you, Cassius,\nThe angry spot doth glow on Caesar\u2019s brow,\nAnd all the rest look like a chidden train.\nCalphurnia\u2019s cheek is pale, and Cicero 195\nLooks with such ferret and such fiery eyes\nAs we have seen him in the Capitol,\nBeing crossed in conference by some senators.\nCASSIUS\nCasca will tell us what the matter is.\nCAESAR Antonius. 200\nANTONY Caesar.\nCAESAR\nLet me have men about me that are fat,\nSleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights.\nYond Cassius has a lean and hungry look.\nHe thinks too much. Such men are dangerous. 205\nANTONY\nFear him not, Caesar; he\u2019s not dangerous.\nHe is a noble Roman, and well given.\nCAESAR\nWould he were fatter! But I fear him not.\nYet if my name were liable to fear,\nI do not know the man I should avoid 210\nSo soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much,\nHe is a great observer, and he looks\nQuite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays,\nAs thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;\nSeldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort 215\nAs if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit\nThat could be moved to smile at anything.\nSuch men as he be never at heart\u2019s ease\nWhiles they behold a greater than themselves,\nAnd therefore are they very dangerous. 220\nI rather tell thee what is to be feared\nThan what I fear; for always I am Caesar.\nCome on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,\nAnd tell me truly what thou think\u2019st of him.\nSennet. Caesar and his train exit\nbut Casca remains behind.\nCASCA You pulled me by the cloak. Would you speak 225\nwith me?\nBRUTUS\nAy, Casca. Tell us what hath chanced today\nThat Caesar looks so sad.\nCASCA Why, you were with him, were you not?\nBRUTUS\nI should not then ask Casca what had chanced. 230\nCASCA Why, there was a crown offered him; and, being\noffered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,\nthus, and then the people fell a-shouting.\nBRUTUS What was the second noise for?\nCASCA Why, for that too. 235\nCASSIUS\nThey shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?\nCASCA Why, for that too.\nBRUTUS Was the crown offered him thrice?\nCASCA Ay, marry, was \u2019t, and he put it by thrice, every\ntime gentler than other; and at every putting-by, 240\nmine honest neighbors shouted.\nCASSIUS Who offered him the crown?\nCASCA Why, Antony.\nBRUTUS\nTell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.\nCASCA I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it. 245\nIt was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark\nAntony offer him a crown (yet \u2019twas not a crown\nneither; \u2019twas one of these coronets), and, as I told\nyou, he put it by once; but for all that, to my\nthinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered 250\nit to him again; then he put it by again; but to my\nthinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it.\nAnd then he offered it the third time. He put it the\nthird time by, and still as he refused it the rabblement\nhooted and clapped their chopped hands and 255\nthrew up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a\ndeal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the\ncrown that it had almost choked Caesar, for he\nswooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part,\nI durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and 260\nreceiving the bad air.\nCASSIUS\nBut soft, I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon?\nCASCA He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at\nmouth and was speechless.\nBRUTUS\n\u2019Tis very like; he hath the falling sickness. 265\nCASSIUS\nNo, Caesar hath it not; but you and I\nAnd honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.\nCASCA I know not what you mean by that, but I am\nsure Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not\nclap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and 270\ndispleased them, as they use to do the players in the\ntheater, I am no true man.\nBRUTUS\nWhat said he when he came unto himself?\nCASCA Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived\nthe common herd was glad he refused the crown, 275\nhe plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his\nthroat to cut. An I had been a man of any occupation,\nif I would not have taken him at a word, I\nwould I might go to hell among the rogues. And so\nhe fell. When he came to himself again, he said if he 280\nhad done or said anything amiss, he desired their\nWorships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four\nwenches where I stood cried \u201cAlas, good soul!\u201d and\nforgave him with all their hearts. But there\u2019s no\nheed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stabbed 285\ntheir mothers, they would have done no less.\nBRUTUS\nAnd, after that, he came thus sad away?\nCASCA Ay.\nCASSIUS Did Cicero say anything?\nCASCA Ay, he spoke Greek. 290\nCASSIUS To what effect?\nCASCA Nay, an I tell you that, I\u2019ll ne\u2019er look you i\u2019 th\u2019\nface again. But those that understood him smiled at\none another and shook their heads. But for mine\nown part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more 295\nnews too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarves\noff Caesar\u2019s images, are put to silence. Fare you\nwell. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember\nit.\nCASSIUS Will you sup with me tonight, Casca? 300\nCASCA No, I am promised forth.\nCASSIUS Will you dine with me tomorrow?\nCASCA Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your\ndinner worth the eating.\nCASSIUS Good. I will expect you. 305\nCASCA Do so. Farewell both. He exits.\nBRUTUS\nWhat a blunt fellow is this grown to be!\nHe was quick mettle when he went to school.\nCASSIUS\nSo is he now in execution\nOf any bold or noble enterprise, 310\nHowever he puts on this tardy form.\nThis rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,\nWhich gives men stomach to digest his words\nWith better appetite.\nBRUTUS\nAnd so it is. For this time I will leave you. 315\nTomorrow, if you please to speak with me,\nI will come home to you; or, if you will,\nCome home to me, and I will wait for you.\nCASSIUS\nI will do so. Till then, think of the world.\nBrutus exits.\nWell, Brutus, thou art noble. Yet I see 320\nThy honorable mettle may be wrought\nFrom that it is disposed. Therefore it is meet\nThat noble minds keep ever with their likes;\nFor who so firm that cannot be seduced?\nCaesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus. 325\nIf I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius,\nHe should not humor me. I will this night\nIn several hands in at his windows throw,\nAs if they came from several citizens,\nWritings, all tending to the great opinion 330\nThat Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely\nCaesar\u2019s ambition shall be glanc\u00e8d at\nAnd after this, let Caesar seat him sure,\nFor we will shake him, or worse days endure.\nHe exits."}
{"act": 1, "scene": 3, "text": "ACT 1\nSCENE 3\nThunder and lightning. Enter Casca and Cicero.\nCICERO\nGood even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home?\nWhy are you breathless? And why stare you so?\nCASCA\nAre not you moved, when all the sway of earth\nShakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,\nI have seen tempests when the scolding winds 5\nHave rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen\nTh\u2019 ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam\nTo be exalted with the threat\u2019ning clouds;\nBut never till tonight, never till now,\nDid I go through a tempest dropping fire. 10\nEither there is a civil strife in heaven,\nOr else the world, too saucy with the gods,\nIncenses them to send destruction.\nCICERO\nWhy, saw you anything more wonderful?\nCASCA\nA common slave (you know him well by sight) 15\nHeld up his left hand, which did flame and burn\nLike twenty torches joined; and yet his hand,\nNot sensible of fire, remained unscorched.\nBesides (I ha\u2019 not since put up my sword),\nAgainst the Capitol I met a lion, 20\nWho glazed upon me and went surly by\nWithout annoying me. And there were drawn\nUpon a heap a hundred ghastly women,\nTransform\u00e8d with their fear, who swore they saw\nMen all in fire walk up and down the streets. 25\nAnd yesterday the bird of night did sit\nEven at noonday upon the marketplace,\nHooting and shrieking. When these prodigies\nDo so conjointly meet, let not men say\n\u201cThese are their reasons, they are natural,\u201d 30\nFor I believe they are portentous things\nUnto the climate that they point upon.\nCICERO\nIndeed, it is a strange-dispos\u00e8d time.\nBut men may construe things after their fashion,\nClean from the purpose of the things themselves. 35\nComes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?\nCASCA\nHe doth, for he did bid Antonius\nSend word to you he would be there tomorrow.\nCICERO\nGood night then, Casca. This disturb\u00e8d sky\nIs not to walk in. 40\nCASCA Farewell, Cicero Cicero exits.\nEnter Cassius.\nCASSIUS\nWho\u2019s there?\nCASCA A Roman.\nCASSIUS Casca, by your voice.\nCASCA\nYour ear is good. Cassius, what night is this! 45\nCASSIUS\nA very pleasing night to honest men.\nCASCA\nWho ever knew the heavens menace so?\nCASSIUS\nThose that have known the Earth so full of faults.\nFor my part, I have walked about the streets,\nSubmitting me unto the perilous night, 50\nAnd thus unbrac\u00e8d, Casca, as you see,\nHave bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;\nAnd when the cross blue lightning seemed to open\nThe breast of heaven, I did present myself\nEven in the aim and very flash of it. 55\nCASCA\nBut wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?\nIt is the part of men to fear and tremble\nWhen the most mighty gods by tokens send\nSuch dreadful heralds to astonish us.\nCASSIUS\nYou are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life 60\nThat should be in a Roman you do want,\nOr else you use not. You look pale, and gaze,\nAnd put on fear, and cast yourself in wonder,\nTo see the strange impatience of the heavens.\nBut if you would consider the true cause 65\nWhy all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,\nWhy birds and beasts from quality and kind,\nWhy old men, fools, and children calculate,\nWhy all these things change from their ordinance,\nTheir natures, and preform\u00e8d faculties, 70\nTo monstrous quality\u2014why, you shall find\nThat heaven hath infused them with these spirits\nTo make them instruments of fear and warning\nUnto some monstrous state.\nNow could I, Casca, name to thee a man 75\nMost like this dreadful night,\nThat thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars\nAs doth the lion in the Capitol;\nA man no mightier than thyself or me\nIn personal action, yet prodigious grown, 80\nAnd fearful, as these strange eruptions are.\nCASCA\n\u2019Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?\nCASSIUS\nLet it be who it is. For Romans now\nHave thews and limbs like to their ancestors.\nBut, woe the while, our fathers\u2019 minds are dead, 85\nAnd we are governed with our mothers\u2019 spirits.\nOur yoke and sufferance show us womanish.\nCASCA\nIndeed, they say the Senators tomorrow\nMean to establish Caesar as a king,\nAnd he shall wear his crown by sea and land 90\nIn every place save here in Italy.\nCASSIUS\nI know where I will wear this dagger then;\nCassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.\nTherein, you gods, you make the weak most strong;\nTherein, you gods, you tyrants do defeat. 95\nNor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,\nNor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,\nCan be retentive to the strength of spirit;\nBut life, being weary of these worldly bars,\nNever lacks power to dismiss itself. 100\nIf I know this, know all the world besides,\nThat part of tyranny that I do bear\nI can shake off at pleasure. Thunder still.\nCASCA So can I.\nSo every bondman in his own hand bears 105\nThe power to cancel his captivity.\nCASSIUS\nAnd why should Caesar be a tyrant, then?\nPoor man, I know he would not be a wolf\nBut that he sees the Romans are but sheep;\nHe were no lion, were not Romans hinds. 110\nThose that with haste will make a mighty fire\nBegin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome,\nWhat rubbish, and what offal when it serves\nFor the base matter to illuminate\nSo vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief, 115\nWhere hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this\nBefore a willing bondman; then, I know\nMy answer must be made. But I am armed,\nAnd dangers are to me indifferent.\nCASCA\nYou speak to Casca, and to such a man 120\nThat is no fleering telltale. Hold. My hand.\nThey shake hands.\nBe factious for redress of all these griefs,\nAnd I will set this foot of mine as far\nAs who goes farthest.\nCASSIUS There\u2019s a bargain made. 125\nNow know you, Casca, I have moved already\nSome certain of the noblest-minded Romans\nTo undergo with me an enterprise\nOf honorable-dangerous consequence.\nAnd I do know by this they stay for me 130\nIn Pompey\u2019s Porch. For now, this fearful night,\nThere is no stir or walking in the streets;\nAnd the complexion of the element\nIn favor \u2019s like the work we have in hand,\nMost bloody, fiery, and most terrible. 135\nEnter Cinna.\nCASCA\nStand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.\nCASSIUS\n\u2019Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait.\nHe is a friend.\u2014Cinna, where haste you so?\nCINNA\nTo find out you. Who\u2019s that? Metellus Cimber?\nCASSIUS\nNo, it is Casca, one incorporate 140\nTo our attempts. Am I not stayed for, Cinna?\nCINNA\nI am glad on \u2019t. What a fearful night is this!\nThere\u2019s two or three of us have seen strange sights.\nCASSIUS Am I not stayed for? Tell me.\nCINNA\nYes, you are. O Cassius, if you could 145\nBut win the noble Brutus to our party\u2014\nCASSIUS, handing him papers\nBe you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,\nAnd look you lay it in the Praetor\u2019s chair,\nWhere Brutus may but find it; and throw this\nIn at his window; set this up with wax 150\nUpon old Brutus\u2019 statue.

{"act": 2, "scene": 1, "text": "ACT 2\nSCENE 1\nEnter Brutus in his orchard.\nBRUTUS What, Lucius, ho!\u2014\nI cannot by the progress of the stars\nGive guess how near to day.\u2014Lucius, I say!\u2014\nI would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.\u2014\nWhen, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius! 5\nEnter Lucius.\nLUCIUS Called you, my lord?\nBRUTUS\nGet me a taper in my study, Lucius.\nWhen it is lighted, come and call me here.\nLUCIUS I will, my lord. He exits.\nBRUTUS\nIt must be by his death. And for my part 10\nI know no personal cause to spurn at him,\nBut for the general. He would be crowned:\nHow that might change his nature, there\u2019s the\nquestion.\nIt is the bright day that brings forth the adder, 15\nAnd that craves wary walking. Crown him that,\nAnd then I grant we put a sting in him\nThat at his will he may do danger with.\nTh\u2019 abuse of greatness is when it disjoins\n49\nRemorse from power. And, to speak truth of Caesar, 20\nI have not known when his affections swayed\nMore than his reason. But \u2019tis a common proof\nThat lowliness is young ambition\u2019s ladder,\nWhereto the climber-upward turns his face;\nBut, when he once attains the upmost round, 25\nHe then unto the ladder turns his back,\nLooks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees\nBy which he did ascend. So Caesar may.\nThen, lest he may, prevent. And since the quarrel\nWill bear no color for the thing he is, 30\nFashion it thus: that what he is, augmented,\nWould run to these and these extremities.\nAnd therefore think him as a serpent\u2019s egg,\nWhich, hatched, would, as his kind, grow\nmischievous, 35\nAnd kill him in the shell.\nEnter Lucius.\nLUCIUS\nThe taper burneth in your closet, sir.\nSearching the window for a flint, I found\nThis paper, thus sealed up, and I am sure\nIt did not lie there when I went to bed. 40\nGives him the letter.\nBRUTUS\nGet you to bed again. It is not day.\nIs not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?\nLUCIUS I know not, sir.\nBRUTUS\nLook in the calendar, and bring me word.\nLUCIUS I will, sir. He exits. 45\nBRUTUS\nThe exhalations, whizzing in the air,\nGive so much light that I may read by them.\nOpens the letter and reads.\nBrutus, thou sleep\u2019st. Awake, and see thyself!\nShall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress!\n\u201cBrutus, thou sleep\u2019st. Awake.\u201d 50\nSuch instigations have been often dropped\nWhere I have took them up.\n\u201cShall Rome, etc.\u201d Thus must I piece it out:\nShall Rome stand under one man\u2019s awe? What,\nRome? 55\nMy ancestors did from the streets of Rome\nThe Tarquin drive when he was called a king.\n\u201cSpeak, strike, redress!\u201d Am I entreated\nTo speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,\nIf the redress will follow, thou receivest 60\nThy full petition at the hand of Brutus.\nEnter Lucius.\nLUCIUS Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.\nKnock within.\nBRUTUS\n\u2019Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.\nLucius exits.\nSince Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,\nI have not slept. 65\nBetween the acting of a dreadful thing\nAnd the first motion, all the interim is\nLike a phantasma or a hideous dream.\nThe genius and the mortal instruments\nAre then in council, and the state of man, 70\nLike to a little kingdom, suffers then\nThe nature of an insurrection.\nEnter Lucius.\nLUCIUS\nSir, \u2019tis your brother Cassius at the door,\nWho doth desire to see you.\nBRUTUS Is he alone? 75\nLUCIUS\nNo, sir. There are more with him.\nBRUTUS Do you know\nthem?\nLUCIUS\nNo, sir. Their hats are plucked about their ears,\nAnd half their faces buried in their cloaks, 80\nThat by no means I may discover them\nBy any mark of favor.\nBRUTUS Let \u2019em enter. Lucius exits.\nThey are the faction. O conspiracy,\nSham\u2019st thou to show thy dang\u2019rous brow by night, 85\nWhen evils are most free? O, then, by day\nWhere wilt thou find a cavern dark enough\nTo mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none,\nconspiracy.\nHide it in smiles and affability; 90\nFor if thou path, thy native semblance on,\nNot Erebus itself were dim enough\nTo hide thee from prevention.\nEnter the conspirators, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna,\nMetellus, and Trebonius.\nCASSIUS\nI think we are too bold upon your rest.\nGood morrow, Brutus. Do we trouble you? 95\nBRUTUS\nI have been up this hour, awake all night.\nKnow I these men that come along with you?\nCASSIUS\nYes, every man of them; and no man here\nBut honors you, and every one doth wish\nYou had but that opinion of yourself 100\nWhich every noble Roman bears of you.\nThis is Trebonius.\nBRUTUS He is welcome hither.\nCASSIUS\nThis, Decius Brutus.\nBRUTUS He is welcome too. 105\nCASSIUS\nThis, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.\nBRUTUS They are all welcome.\nWhat watchful cares do interpose themselves\nBetwixt your eyes and night?\nCASSIUS Shall I entreat a word? 110\nBrutus and Cassius whisper.\nDECIUS\nHere lies the east; doth not the day break here?\nCASCA No.\nCINNA\nO pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines\nThat fret the clouds are messengers of day.\nCASCA\nYou shall confess that you are both deceived. 115\nHere, as I point my sword, the sun arises,\nWhich is a great way growing on the south,\nWeighing the youthful season of the year.\nSome two months hence, up higher toward the\nnorth 120\nHe first presents his fire, and the high east\nStands, as the Capitol, directly here.\nBRUTUS, coming forward with Cassius\nGive me your hands all over, one by one.\nCASSIUS\nAnd let us swear our resolution.\nBRUTUS\nNo, not an oath. If not the face of men, 125\nThe sufferance of our souls, the time\u2019s abuse\u2014\nIf these be motives weak, break off betimes,\nAnd every man hence to his idle bed.\nSo let high-sighted tyranny range on\nTill each man drop by lottery. But if these\u2014 130\nAs I am sure they do\u2014bear fire enough\nTo kindle cowards and to steel with valor\nThe melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,\nWhat need we any spur but our own cause\nTo prick us to redress? What other bond 135\nThan secret Romans that have spoke the word\nAnd will not palter? And what other oath\nThan honesty to honesty engaged\nThat this shall be or we will fall for it?\nSwear priests and cowards and men cautelous, 140\nOld feeble carrions, and such suffering souls\nThat welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear\nSuch creatures as men doubt; but do not stain\nThe even virtue of our enterprise,\nNor th\u2019 insuppressive mettle of our spirits, 145\nTo think that or our cause or our performance\nDid need an oath, when every drop of blood\nThat every Roman bears, and nobly bears,\nIs guilty of a several bastardy\nIf he do break the smallest particle 150\nOf any promise that hath passed from him.\nCASSIUS\nBut what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?\nI think he will stand very strong with us.\nCASCA\nLet us not leave him out.\nCINNA No, by no means. 155\nMETELLUS\nO, let us have him, for his silver hairs\nWill purchase us a good opinion\nAnd buy men\u2019s voices to commend our deeds.\nIt shall be said his judgment ruled our hands.\nOur youths and wildness shall no whit appear, 160\nBut all be buried in his gravity.\nBRUTUS\nO, name him not! Let us not break with him,\nFor he will never follow anything\nThat other men begin.\nCASSIUS Then leave him out. 165\nCASCA Indeed, he is not fit.\nDECIUS\nShall no man else be touched, but only Caesar?\nCASSIUS\nDecius, well urged. I think it is not meet\nMark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,\nShould outlive Caesar. We shall find of him 170\nA shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,\nIf he improve them, may well stretch so far\nAs to annoy us all; which to prevent,\nLet Antony and Caesar fall together.\nBRUTUS\nOur course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius, 175\nTo cut the head off and then hack the limbs,\nLike wrath in death and envy afterwards;\nFor Antony is but a limb of Caesar.\nLet\u2019s be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.\nWe all stand up against the spirit of Caesar, 180\nAnd in the spirit of men there is no blood.\nO, that we then could come by Caesar\u2019s spirit\nAnd not dismember Caesar! But, alas,\nCaesar must bleed for it. And, gentle friends,\nLet\u2019s kill him boldly, but not wrathfully. 185\nLet\u2019s carve him as a dish fit for the gods,\nNot hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.\nAnd let our hearts, as subtle masters do,\nStir up their servants to an act of rage\nAnd after seem to chide \u2019em. This shall make 190\nOur purpose necessary and not envious;\nWhich so appearing to the common eyes,\nWe shall be called purgers, not murderers.\nAnd for Mark Antony, think not of him,\nFor he can do no more than Caesar\u2019s arm 195\nWhen Caesar\u2019s head is off.\nCASSIUS Yet I fear him,\nFor in the engrafted love he bears to Caesar\u2014\nBRUTUS\nAlas, good Cassius, do not think of him.\nIf he love Caesar, all that he can do 200\nIs to himself: take thought and die for Caesar.\nAnd that were much he should, for he is given\nTo sports, to wildness, and much company.\nTREBONIUS\nThere is no fear in him. Let him not die,\nFor he will live and laugh at this hereafter. 205\nClock strikes.\nBRUTUS\nPeace, count the clock.\nCASSIUS The clock hath stricken\nthree.\nTREBONIUS\n\u2019Tis time to part.\nCASSIUS But it is doubtful yet 210\nWhether Caesar will come forth today or no,\nFor he is superstitious grown of late,\nQuite from the main opinion he held once\nOf fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.\nIt may be these apparent prodigies, 215\nThe unaccustomed terror of this night,\nAnd the persuasion of his augurers\nMay hold him from the Capitol today.\nDECIUS\nNever fear that. If he be so resolved,\nI can o\u2019ersway him, for he loves to hear 220\nThat unicorns may be betrayed with trees,\nAnd bears with glasses, elephants with holes,\nLions with toils, and men with flatterers.\nBut when I tell him he hates flatterers,\nHe says he does, being then most flatter\u00e8d. 225\nLet me work,\nFor I can give his humor the true bent,\nAnd I will bring him to the Capitol.\nCASSIUS\nNay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.\nBRUTUS\nBy the eighth hour, is that the uttermost? 230\nCINNA\nBe that the uttermost, and fail not then.\nMETELLUS\nCaius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,\nWho rated him for speaking well of Pompey.\nI wonder none of you have thought of him.\nBRUTUS\nNow, good Metellus, go along by him. 235\nHe loves me well, and I have given him reasons.\nSend him but hither, and I\u2019ll fashion him.\nCASSIUS\nThe morning comes upon \u2019s. We\u2019ll leave you,\nBrutus.\nAnd, friends, disperse yourselves, but all remember 240\nWhat you have said, and show yourselves true\nRomans.\nBRUTUS\nGood gentlemen, look fresh and merrily.\nLet not our looks put on our purposes,\nBut bear it, as our Roman actors do, 245\nWith untired spirits and formal constancy.\nAnd so good morrow to you every one.\nAll but Brutus exit.\nBoy! Lucius!\u2014Fast asleep? It is no matter.\nEnjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber.\nThou hast no figures nor no fantasies 250\nWhich busy care draws in the brains of men.\nTherefore thou sleep\u2019st so sound.\nEnter Portia.\nPORTIA Brutus, my lord.\nBRUTUS\nPortia! What mean you? Wherefore rise you now?\nIt is not for your health thus to commit 255\nYour weak condition to the raw cold morning.\nPORTIA\nNor for yours neither. You\u2019ve ungently, Brutus,\nStole from my bed. And yesternight at supper\nYou suddenly arose and walked about,\nMusing and sighing, with your arms across, 260\nAnd when I asked you what the matter was,\nYou stared upon me with ungentle looks.\nI urged you further; then you scratched your head\nAnd too impatiently stamped with your foot.\nYet I insisted; yet you answered not, 265\nBut with an angry wafture of your hand\nGave sign for me to leave you. So I did,\nFearing to strengthen that impatience\nWhich seemed too much enkindled, and withal\nHoping it was but an effect of humor, 270\nWhich sometime hath his hour with every man.\nIt will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep,\nAnd could it work so much upon your shape\nAs it hath much prevailed on your condition,\nI should not know you Brutus. Dear my lord, 275\nMake me acquainted with your cause of grief.\nBRUTUS\nI am not well in health, and that is all.\nPORTIA\nBrutus is wise and, were he not in health,\nHe would embrace the means to come by it.\nBRUTUS\nWhy so I do. Good Portia, go to bed. 280\nPORTIA\nIs Brutus sick? And is it physical\nTo walk unbrac\u00e8d and suck up the humors\nOf the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,\nAnd will he steal out of his wholesome bed\nTo dare the vile contagion of the night 285\nAnd tempt the rheumy and unpurg\u00e8d air\nTo add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus,\nYou have some sick offense within your mind,\nWhich by the right and virtue of my place\nI ought to know of. She kneels. And upon my 290\nknees\nI charm you, by my once commended beauty,\nBy all your vows of love, and that great vow\nWhich did incorporate and make us one,\nThat you unfold to me, your self, your half, 295\nWhy you are heavy, and what men tonight\nHave had resort to you; for here have been\nSome six or seven who did hide their faces\nEven from darkness.\nBRUTUS Kneel not, gentle Portia. 300\nHe lifts her up.\nPORTIA\nI should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.\nWithin the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,\nIs it excepted I should know no secrets\nThat appertain to you? Am I your self\nBut, as it were, in sort or limitation, 305\nTo keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,\nAnd talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the\nsuburbs\nOf your good pleasure? If it be no more,\nPortia is Brutus\u2019 harlot, not his wife. 310\nBRUTUS\nYou are my true and honorable wife,\nAs dear to me as are the ruddy drops\nThat visit my sad heart.\nPORTIA\nIf this were true, then should I know this secret.\nI grant I am a woman, but withal 315\nA woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.\nI grant I am a woman, but withal\nA woman well-reputed, Cato\u2019s daughter.\nThink you I am no stronger than my sex,\nBeing so fathered and so husbanded? 320\nTell me your counsels; I will not disclose \u2019em.\nI have made strong proof of my constancy,\nGiving myself a voluntary wound\nHere, in the thigh. Can I bear that with patience,\nAnd not my husband\u2019s secrets? 325\nBRUTUS O you gods,\nRender me worthy of this noble wife! Knock.\nHark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile,\nAnd by and by thy bosom shall partake\nThe secrets of my heart. 330\nAll my engagements I will construe to thee,\nAll the charactery of my sad brows.\nLeave me with haste. Portia exits.\nLucius, who \u2019s that knocks?\nEnter Lucius and Ligarius.\nLUCIUS\nHere is a sick man that would speak with you. 335\nBRUTUS\nCaius Ligarius, that Metellus spoke of.\u2014\nBoy, stand aside. Lucius exits.\nCaius Ligarius, how?\nLIGARIUS\nVouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.\nBRUTUS\nO, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius, 340\nTo wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!\nLIGARIUS\nI am not sick, if Brutus have in hand\nAny exploit worthy the name of honor.\nBRUTUS\nSuch an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,\nHad you a healthful ear to hear of it. 345\nLIGARIUS\nBy all the gods that Romans bow before,\nI here discard my sickness.\nHe takes off his kerchief.\nSoul of Rome,\nBrave son derived from honorable loins,\nThou like an exorcist hast conjured up 350\nMy mortifi\u00e8d spirit. Now bid me run,\nAnd I will strive with things impossible,\nYea, get the better of them. What\u2019s to do?\nBRUTUS\nA piece of work that will make sick men whole.\nLIGARIUS\nBut are not some whole that we must make sick? 355\nBRUTUS\nThat must we also. What it is, my Caius,\nI shall unfold to thee as we are going\nTo whom it must be done.\nLIGARIUS Set on your foot,\nAnd with a heart new-fired I follow you 360\nTo do I know not what; but it sufficeth\nThat Brutus leads me on. Thunder.\nBRUTUS Follow me then.\nThey exit."}

I will not come.\nThat is enough to satisfy the Senate.\nBut for your private satisfaction,\nBecause I love you, I will let you know.\nCalphurnia here, my wife, stays me at home. 80\nShe dreamt tonight she saw my statue,\nWhich, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,\nDid run pure blood; and many lusty Romans\nCame smiling and did bathe their hands in it.\nAnd these does she apply for warnings and portents 85\nAnd evils imminent, and on her knee\nHath begged that I will stay at home today.\nDECIUS\nThis dream is all amiss interpreted.\nIt was a vision fair and fortunate.\nYour statue spouting blood in many pipes, 90\nIn which so many smiling Romans bathed,\nSignifies that from you great Rome shall suck\nReviving blood, and that great men shall press\nFor tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance.\nThis by Calphurnia\u2019s dream is signified. 95\nCAESAR\nAnd this way have you well expounded it.\nDECIUS\nI have, when you have heard what I can say.\nAnd know it now: the Senate have concluded\nTo give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.\nIf you shall send them word you will not come, 100\nTheir minds may change. Besides, it were a mock\nApt to be rendered, for someone to say\n\u201cBreak up the Senate till another time,\nWhen Caesar\u2019s wife shall meet with better dreams.\u201d\nIf Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper 105\n\u201cLo, Caesar is afraid\u201d?\nPardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love\nTo your proceeding bids me tell you this,\nAnd reason to my love is liable.\nCAESAR\nHow foolish do your fears seem now, Calphurnia! 110\nI am asham\u00e8d I did yield to them.\nGive me my robe, for I will go.\nEnter Brutus, Ligarius, Metellus, Casca, Trebonius,\nCinna, and Publius.\nAnd look where Publius is come to fetch me.\nPUBLIUS\nGood morrow, Caesar.\nCAESAR Welcome, Publius.\u2014 115\nWhat, Brutus, are you stirred so early too?\u2014\nGood morrow, Casca.\u2014Caius Ligarius,\nCaesar was ne\u2019er so much your enemy\nAs that same ague which hath made you lean.\u2014\nWhat is \u2019t o\u2019clock? 120\nBRUTUS Caesar, \u2019tis strucken eight.\nCAESAR\nI thank you for your pains and courtesy.\nEnter Antony.\nSee, Antony that revels long a-nights\nIs notwithstanding up.\u2014Good morrow, Antony.\nANTONY So to most noble Caesar. 125\nCAESAR, to Servant Bid them prepare within.\u2014\nI am to blame to be thus waited for.

If this be known,\nCassius or Caesar never shall turn back,\nFor I will slay myself.\nBRUTUS Cassius, be constant. 25\nPopilius Lena speaks not of our purposes,\nFor look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.\nCASSIUS\nTrebonius knows his time, for look you, Brutus,\nHe draws Mark Antony out of the way.\nTrebonius and Antony exit.\nDECIUS\nWhere is Metellus Cimber? Let him go 30\nAnd presently prefer his suit to Caesar.\nBRUTUS\nHe is addressed. Press near and second him.\nCINNA\nCasca, you are the first that rears your hand.\nCAESAR\nAre we all ready?

Fare thee well.\u2014\nI know not, gentlemen, what you intend,\nWho else must be let blood, who else is rank.\nIf I myself, there is no hour so fit\nAs Caesar\u2019s death\u2019s hour, nor no instrument 170\nOf half that worth as those your swords made rich\nWith the most noble blood of all this world.\nI do beseech you, if you bear me hard,\nNow, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,\nFulfill your pleasure.

For your part,\nTo you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony.\nOur arms in strength of malice, and our hearts 190\nOf brothers\u2019 temper, do receive you in\nWith all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.\nCASSIUS\nYour voice shall be as strong as any man\u2019s\nIn the disposing of new dignities.\nBRUTUS\nOnly be patient till we have appeased 195\nThe multitude, beside themselves with fear;\nAnd then we will deliver you the cause\nWhy I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,\nHave thus proceeded.\nANTONY I doubt not of your wisdom. 200\nLet each man render me his bloody hand.\nFirst, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you.\u2014\nNext, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.\u2014\nNow, Decius Brutus, yours;\u2014now yours,\nMetellus;\u2014 205\nYours, Cinna;\u2014and, my valiant Casca, yours;\u2014\nThough last, not least in love, yours, good\nTrebonius.\u2014\nGentlemen all\u2014alas, what shall I say?\nMy credit now stands on such slippery ground 210\nThat one of two bad ways you must conceit me,\nEither a coward or a flatterer.\u2014\nThat I did love thee, Caesar, O, \u2019tis true!\nIf then thy spirit look upon us now,\nShall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death 215\nTo see thy Antony making his peace,\nShaking the bloody fingers of thy foes\u2014\nMost noble!\u2014in the presence of thy corpse?\nHad I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,\nWeeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood, 220\nIt would become me better than to close\nIn terms of friendship with thine enemies.\nPardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bayed, brave\nhart,\nHere didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand 225\nSigned in thy spoil and crimsoned in thy Lethe.\nO world, thou wast the forest to this hart,\nAnd this indeed, O world, the heart of thee.\nHow like a deer strucken by many princes\nDost thou here lie! 230\nCASSIUS\nMark Antony\u2014\nANTONY Pardon me, Caius Cassius.\nThe enemies of Caesar shall say this;\nThen, in a friend, it is cold modesty.\nCASSIUS\nI blame you not for praising Caesar so. 235\nBut what compact mean you to have with us?\nWill you be pricked in number of our friends,\nOr shall we on and not depend on you?\nANTONY\nTherefore I took your hands, but was indeed\nSwayed from the point by looking down on Caesar. 240\nFriends am I with you all and love you all,\nUpon this hope, that you shall give me reasons\nWhy and wherein Caesar was dangerous.\nBRUTUS\nOr else were this a savage spectacle.\nOur reasons are so full of good regard 245\nThat were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,\nYou should be satisfied.\nANTONY That\u2019s all I seek;\nAnd am, moreover, suitor that I may\nProduce his body to the marketplace, 250\nAnd in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,\nSpeak in the order of his funeral.\nBRUTUS\nYou shall, Mark Antony.\nCASSIUS Brutus, a word with you.\nAside to Brutus. You know not what you do. Do 255\nnot consent\nThat Antony speak in his funeral.\nKnow you how much the people may be moved\nBy that which he will utter?\nBRUTUS, aside to Cassius By your pardon, 260\nI will myself into the pulpit first\nAnd show the reason of our Caesar\u2019s death.\nWhat Antony shall speak I will protest\nHe speaks by leave and by permission,\nAnd that we are contented Caesar shall 265\nHave all true rites and lawful ceremonies.\nIt shall advantage more than do us wrong.\nCASSIUS, aside to Brutus\nI know not what may fall. I like it not.\nBRUTUS\nMark Antony, here, take you Caesar\u2019s body.\nYou shall not in your funeral speech blame us 270\nBut speak all good you can devise of Caesar\nAnd say you do \u2019t by our permission,\nElse shall you not have any hand at all\nAbout his funeral. And you shall speak\nIn the same pulpit whereto I am going, 275\nAfter my speech is ended.\nANTONY Be it so.\nI do desire no more.\nBRUTUS\nPrepare the body, then, and follow us.\nAll but Antony exit.\nANTONY\nO pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth, 280\nThat I am meek and gentle with these butchers.\nThou art the ruins of the noblest man\nThat ever liv\u00e8d in the tide of times.\nWoe to the hand that shed this costly blood!\nOver thy wounds now do I prophesy 285\n(Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips\nTo beg the voice and utterance of my tongue)\nA curse shall light upon the limbs of men;\nDomestic fury and fierce civil strife\nShall cumber all the parts of Italy; 290\nBlood and destruction shall be so in use\nAnd dreadful objects so familiar\nThat mothers shall but smile when they behold\nTheir infants quartered with the hands of war,\nAll pity choked with custom of fell deeds; 295\nAnd Caesar\u2019s spirit, ranging for revenge,\nWith Ate by his side come hot from hell,\nShall in these confines with a monarch\u2019s voice\nCry \u201cHavoc!\u201d and let slip the dogs of war,\nThat this foul deed shall smell above the earth 300\nWith carrion men groaning for burial.\nEnter Octavius\u2019 Servant.\nYou serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?\nSERVANT I do, Mark Antony.\nANTONY\nCaesar did write for him to come to Rome.\nSERVANT\nHe did receive his letters and is coming, 305\nAnd bid me say to you by word of mouth\u2014\nO Caesar!\nANTONY\nThy heart is big. Get thee apart and weep.\nPassion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes,\nSeeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine, 310\nBegan to water. Is thy master coming?\nSERVANT\nHe lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.\nANTONY\nPost back with speed and tell him what hath\nchanced.\nHere is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome, 315\nNo Rome of safety for Octavius yet.\nHie hence and tell him so.\u2014Yet stay awhile;\nThou shalt not back till I have borne this corpse\nInto the marketplace. There shall I try,\nIn my oration, how the people take 320\nThe cruel issue of these bloody men,\nAccording to the which thou shalt discourse\nTo young Octavius of the state of things.\nLend me your hand.\nThey exit with Caesar\u2019s body."}

If there be any in this assembly, any dear\nfriend of Caesar\u2019s, to him I say that Brutus\u2019 love 20\nto Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend\ndemand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my\nanswer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved\nRome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and\ndie all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all 25\nfreemen? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him. As he\nwas fortunate, I rejoice at it. As he was valiant, I\nhonor him. But, as he was ambitious, I slew him.\nThere is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor\nfor his valor, and death for his ambition. Who is 30\nhere so base that would be a bondman? If any,\nspeak, for him have I offended. Who is here so rude\nthat would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him\nhave I offended. Who is here so vile that will not\nlove his country? If any, speak, for him have I 35\noffended. I pause for a reply.\nPLEBEIANS None, Brutus, none.\nBRUTUS Then none have I offended. I have done no\nmore to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The\nquestion of his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his 40\nglory not extenuated wherein he was worthy, nor\nhis offenses enforced for which he suffered death.\nEnter Mark Antony and others with Caesar\u2019s body.\nHere comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony,\nwho, though he had no hand in his death, shall\nreceive the benefit of his dying\u2014a place in the 45\ncommonwealth\u2014as which of you shall not?

Let us hear him.\nANTONY\nFriends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.\nI come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.\nThe evil that men do lives after them;\nThe good is oft interr\u00e8d with their bones. 85\nSo let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus\nHath told you Caesar was ambitious.\nIf it were so, it was a grievous fault,\nAnd grievously hath Caesar answered it.\nHere, under leave of Brutus and the rest 90\n(For Brutus is an honorable man;\nSo are they all, all honorable men),\nCome I to speak in Caesar\u2019s funeral.\nHe was my friend, faithful and just to me,\nBut Brutus says he was ambitious, 95\nAnd Brutus is an honorable man.\nHe hath brought many captives home to Rome,\nWhose ransoms did the general coffers fill.\nDid this in Caesar seem ambitious?\nWhen that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept; 100\nAmbition should be made of sterner stuff.\nYet Brutus says he was ambitious,\nAnd Brutus is an honorable man.\nYou all did see that on the Lupercal\nI thrice presented him a kingly crown, 105\nWhich he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?\nYet Brutus says he was ambitious,\nAnd sure he is an honorable man.\nI speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,\nBut here I am to speak what I do know. 110\nYou all did love him once, not without cause.\nWhat cause withholds you, then, to mourn for\nhim?\u2014\nO judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,\nAnd men have lost their reason!\u2014Bear with me; 115\nMy heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,\nAnd I must pause till it come back to me. He weeps.\nFIRST PLEBEIAN\nMethinks there is much reason in his sayings.\nSECOND PLEBEIAN\nIf thou consider rightly of the matter,\nCaesar has had great wrong. 120\nTHIRD PLEBEIAN Has he, masters?\nI fear there will a worse come in his place.\nFOURTH PLEBEIAN\nMarked you his words? He would not take the\ncrown;\nTherefore \u2019tis certain he was not ambitious. 125\nFIRST PLEBEIAN\nIf it be found so, some will dear abide it.\nSECOND PLEBEIAN\nPoor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping.\nTHIRD PLEBEIAN\nThere\u2019s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.\nFOURTH PLEBEIAN\nNow mark him.

I rather choose\nTo wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,\nThan I will wrong such honorable men.\nBut here\u2019s a parchment with the seal of Caesar. 140\nI found it in his closet. \u2019Tis his will.\nLet but the commons hear this testament,\nWhich, pardon me, I do not mean to read,\nAnd they would go and kiss dead Caesar\u2019s wounds\nAnd dip their napkins in his sacred blood\u2014 145\nYea, beg a hair of him for memory\nAnd, dying, mention it within their wills,\nBequeathing it as a rich legacy\nUnto their issue.\nFOURTH PLEBEIAN\nWe\u2019ll hear the will.

I must not read it.\nIt is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.\nYou are not wood, you are not stones, but men.\nAnd, being men, hearing the will of Caesar, 155\nIt will inflame you; it will make you mad.\n\u2019Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,\nFor if you should, O, what would come of it?\nFOURTH PLEBEIAN\nRead the will! We\u2019ll hear it, Antony.\nPLEBEIANS\nYou shall read us the will, Caesar\u2019s will. 160\nANTONY\nWill you be patient? Will you stay awhile?\nI have o\u2019ershot myself to tell you of it.\nI fear I wrong the honorable men\nWhose daggers have stabbed Caesar. I do fear it.\nFOURTH PLEBEIAN They were traitors. Honorable men? 165\nPLEBEIANS The will! The testament!\nSECOND PLEBEIAN They were villains, murderers. The\nwill! Read the will.\nANTONY\nYou will compel me, then, to read the will?\nThen make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, 170\nAnd let me show you him that made the will.\nShall I descend? And will you give me leave?\nPLEBEIANS Come down.\nSECOND PLEBEIAN Descend.\nTHIRD PLEBEIAN You shall have leave. 175\nAntony descends.\nFOURTH PLEBEIAN A ring; stand round.\nFIRST PLEBEIAN\nStand from the hearse.

I remember\nThe first time ever Caesar put it on.\n\u2019Twas on a summer\u2019s evening in his tent,\nThat day he overcame the Nervii. 185\nLook, in this place ran Cassius\u2019 dagger through.\nSee what a rent the envious Casca made.\nThrough this the well-belov\u00e8d Brutus stabbed,\nAnd, as he plucked his curs\u00e8d steel away,\nMark how the blood of Caesar followed it, 190\nAs rushing out of doors to be resolved\nIf Brutus so unkindly knocked or no;\nFor Brutus, as you know, was Caesar\u2019s angel.\nJudge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!\nThis was the most unkindest cut of all. 195\nFor when the noble Caesar saw him stab,\nIngratitude, more strong than traitors\u2019 arms,\nQuite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart,\nAnd, in his mantle muffling up his face,\nEven at the base of Pompey\u2019s statue 200\n(Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell.\nO, what a fall was there, my countrymen!\nThen I and you and all of us fell down,\nWhilst bloody treason flourished over us.\nO, now you weep, and I perceive you feel 205\nThe dint of pity.

We\u2019ll revenge his death.\nTHIRD PLEBEIAN O royal Caesar!\nANTONY Hear me with patience.\nPLEBEIANS Peace, ho! 260\nANTONY\nMoreover, he hath left you all his walks,\nHis private arbors, and new-planted orchards,\nOn this side Tiber. He hath left them you,\nAnd to your heirs forever\u2014common pleasures\nTo walk abroad and recreate yourselves. 265\nHere was a Caesar! When comes such another?\nFIRST PLEBEIAN\nNever, never!\u2014Come, away, away!\nWe\u2019ll burn his body in the holy place\nAnd with the brands fire the traitors\u2019 houses.\nTake up the body. 270\nSECOND PLEBEIAN Go fetch fire.\nTHIRD PLEBEIAN Pluck down benches.\nFOURTH PLEBEIAN Pluck down forms, windows,\nanything.\nPlebeians exit with Caesar\u2019s body.\nANTONY\nNow let it work.

Fortune is merry\nAnd in this mood will give us anything.\nSERVANT\nI heard him say Brutus and Cassius\nAre rid like madmen through the gates of Rome. 285\nANTONY\nBelike they had some notice of the people\nHow I had moved them.

Now I change my mind 85\nAnd partly credit things that do presage.\nComing from Sardis, on our former ensign\nTwo mighty eagles fell, and there they perched,\nGorging and feeding from our soldiers\u2019 hands,\nWho to Philippi here consorted us. 90\nThis morning are they fled away and gone,\nAnd in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites\nFly o\u2019er our heads and downward look on us\nAs we were sickly prey. Their shadows seem\nA canopy most fatal, under which 95\nOur army lies, ready to give up the ghost.\nMESSALA\nBelieve not so.\nCASSIUS I but believe it partly,\nFor I am fresh of spirit and resolved\nTo meet all perils very constantly. 100\nBRUTUS\nEven so, Lucilius. Brutus returns to Cassius.\nCASSIUS Now, most noble Brutus,\nThe gods today stand friendly that we may,\nLovers in peace, lead on our days to age.\nBut since the affairs of men rests still incertain, 105\nLet\u2019s reason with the worst that may befall.\nIf we do lose this battle, then is this\nThe very last time we shall speak together.\nWhat are you then determin\u00e8d to do?\nBRUTUS\nEven by the rule of that philosophy 110\nBy which I did blame Cato for the death\nWhich he did give himself (I know not how,\nBut I do find it cowardly and vile,\nFor fear of what might fall, so to prevent\nThe time of life), arming myself with patience 115\nTo stay the providence of some high powers\nThat govern us below.\nCASSIUS Then, if we lose this battle,\nYou are contented to be led in triumph\nThorough the streets of Rome? 120\nBRUTUS\nNo, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman,\nThat ever Brutus will go bound to Rome.\nHe bears too great a mind. But this same day\nMust end that work the ides of March begun.\nAnd whether we shall meet again, I know not. 125\nTherefore our everlasting farewell take.\nForever and forever farewell, Cassius.\nIf we do meet again, why we shall smile;\nIf not, why then this parting was well made.\nCASSIUS\nForever and forever farewell, Brutus. 130\nIf we do meet again, we\u2019ll smile indeed;\nIf not, \u2019tis true this parting was well made.\nBRUTUS\nWhy then, lead on.\u2014O, that a man might know\nThe end of this day\u2019s business ere it come!\nBut it sufficeth that the day will end, 135\nAnd then the end is known.\u2014Come ho, away!\nThey exit."}
